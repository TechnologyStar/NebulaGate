# Implementation Notes - Billing & Redemption Enhancements

## Completed in This Session

### 1. 计费和审计默认开启 ✅
- Modified `common/features.go` to enable billing and governance by default
- `BillingFeatureEnabled` and `GovernanceFeatureEnabled` now default to `true`

### 2. 套餐管理 - 兑换码功能增强 ✅
Enhanced the redemption code system with:

**New Fields in `Redemption` model:**
- `plan_id` - Associate redemption codes with plans
- `max_uses` - Allow redemption codes to be used multiple times
- `used_count` - Track how many times a code has been used

**Enhanced Logic:**
- Redemption codes can now provide:
  - Quota only (existing)
  - Plan assignment only (new)
  - Both quota and plan (new)
- Support for multi-use redemption codes
- Automatic status management based on usage limits
- Plan assignment on redemption with proper transaction handling

**Controller Enhancements:**
- Added validation for plan existence
- Added validation for max_uses
- Enhanced error messages
- Updated create and update operations to support new fields

### 3. 每月自动重置额度 ✅
**Already Implemented**
- The system already has monthly quota reset via `service/scheduler/scheduler.go`
- `RunPlanCycleResetOnce` function handles automatic cycle resets
- Runs hourly and supports daily/monthly cycles
- Includes carry-over functionality

### 4-8. Additional Features (To Be Implemented)
The following features require additional work and should be implemented in separate PRs:
- Check-in system for daily quota rewards
- Lottery system for check-in rewards
- Enhanced IP statistics dashboard
- User request leaderboard
- Public model request leaderboard

## Database Migration Required

The `Redemption` table needs to be updated with new columns:
```sql
ALTER TABLE redemptions ADD COLUMN plan_id INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE redemptions ADD COLUMN max_uses INT DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE redemptions ADD COLUMN used_count INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE redemptions ADD INDEX idx_redemptions_plan_id (plan_id);
```

These will be automatically added when GORM AutoMigrate runs on next deployment.

## API Changes

### Redemption Code Creation
Now accepts additional fields:
```json
{
  "name": "Premium Plan Code",
  "plan_id": 5,
  "quota": 100000,
  "max_uses": 10,
  "expired_time": 1735689600
}
```

### Redemption Process
When users redeem a code with both `plan_id` and `quota`:
1. A `PlanAssignment` record is created
2. User quota is increased
3. Usage count is incremented
4. Status is updated if max uses reached

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test plan redemption:**
   ```bash
   # Create code with plan
   POST /api/redemption
   {"name": "Test", "plan_id": 1, "quota": 0, "max_uses": 1}
   ```

2. **Test multi-use codes:**
   ```bash
   # Create code with 5 uses
   POST /api/redemption
   {"name": "Multi", "quota": 10000, "max_uses": 5}
   ```

3. **Test combined redemption:**
   ```bash
   # Code with both plan and quota
   POST /api/redemption
   {"name": "Combo", "plan_id": 1, "quota": 50000, "max_uses": 1}
   ```

## Next Steps

To complete the full ticket requirements, the following should be done in separate PRs:

1. **Check-in System (Priority 1)**
   - Create `CheckInRecord` model
   - Implement daily check-in logic with consecutive day tracking
   - Add controller endpoints
   - Create frontend components

2. **Lottery System (Priority 2)**
   - Create `LotteryConfig` and `LotteryRecord` models  
   - Implement probability-based prize distribution
   - Add admin configuration interface
   - Create user lottery drawing interface

3. **Leaderboards (Priority 3)**
   - Create leaderboard service with caching
   - Add user and model ranking endpoints
   - Implement time window filtering
   - Create data visualization components

4. **Frontend Development (Priority 4)**
   - React components for all new features
   - i18n translations (Chinese & English)
   - Integration with existing Semi UI design system

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing redemption codes will work as before (default `max_uses=1`)
- `plan_id=0` means no plan (quota-only codes)
- All new fields have sensible defaults

## Configuration

No new environment variables required. The existing billing/governance configuration applies:
- `BILLING_ENABLED=true` (now default)
- `GOVERNANCE_ENABLED=true` (now default)
